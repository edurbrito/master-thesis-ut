Before we jump into the definitions,
I would like you all to think,
for a brief moment, in a couple
of scenarios:

How would Joe Biden prove the
authenticity of his wonderful
review of Heaven Pizzeria?
Or the Pope after buying that 
brand new fancy jacket?
How would a reporter certify
the autheticity of his media content
covering an important event?
Or a service provider proving 
the delivery or supply of goods 
at a certain location?
How can I prove to someone else later
that I was here in this room 
before you and at this moment in time, 
defending my thesis?

These are part of the set 
of today's problems
the typical GPS-based 
location systems,
mapping platforms, 
or mobility and ride-hailing apps
do not provide straight answers for.
With this present surge of highly 
realistic generative AI tools,
what we may need instead is 
a paradigm shift,
towards digital Proofs of Location.

---------------------------

These proofs are nothing more profound
than electronic certificates that
attest one's position 
in both space and time.

To get such proofs,
some arrangements between 
different types of entities
should be put in place.

Typically,
these location-proof setups 
expect the existence of a prover 
that engages in any communication 
protocol with nearby participants,
the witnesses, with the goal of 
gathering a verifiable 
Proof-of-Location claim, to be later
presented to a verifier, 
therefore convincing it of oneâ€™s 
existence within a geographical
area, at a given moment.

In this thesis, we started by
dissecting this 
Proof-of-Location systems' paradigm
And did as well a review of 
the state of the art.
Starting from centralized and trusted solutions 
where trusted entities would interact
via short range communication
and provide verified space and time claims
to each other,
we advanced towards decentralized and 
infrastructure-independent approaches. 
The distribution of trust, resources,
power, and fault-tolerance has driven 
the development of modern protocols, 
culminating in the need for not only
short-range communication but also
decentralized time synchronization.
To leave you with some thoughts
How could we all agree to be 
here in this room, now,
if our clocks were not synchronized
and marking a similar time?

These are the main ideas behind most
Proof-of-Location protocols, 
which are generally considered secure if 
complete, meaning, 
containing space and time witnessing references,
spatio-temporally sound, or in other words,
if it's very hard for the prover to get a valid
proof if not physically present 
at that specific location and time,
and non-transferable, meaning,
valid only for that prover.

--------------------------------------------

Having identified this need for both
space and time synchronization,
our second set of contributions
was design of a novel decentralized
Proof-of-Location protocol and 
the implementation of a proof-of-concept.
