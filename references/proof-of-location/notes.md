# Blockchain-based Proof of Location

LBSs take advantage of geographic location to provide users with accurate and targeted information for locating friends on a map, discovering nearby social events [2], generating alerts about traffic jams along a route [3], and more.

A proof of location can be seen as a digital certificate that attests someone’s presence at a certain geographic location, at a certain time.

It is worth nothing that most proof-of-location schemes are centralized, i.e., they rely on servers for storing proofs of location, which users have to trust either explicitly
or implicitly.

# Proof of witness presence: Blockchain consensus for augmented democracy in smart cities

While witness presence can be seen as a political statement, it is actually a highly complex techno-socio-economic problem in the context of the proposed augmented democracy paradigm: Proving of being present at a certain location, at a certain time with a certain situation awareness in order to perform certain actions, while having the incentive to participate.

Recently, decentralized algorithms for Byzantine fault-tolerant clock synchronization have been studied [59,72]. These algorithms run by autonomous interactive wireless receivers and transmitters, i.e. beacons, that self-determine via their communication the geometry of their zone coverage without third parties. By reaching an agreement about a common time (not necessarily a UTC time), specific locations can be accurately detected via trilateration [73].

However, GPS is a single point of failure, it is highly susceptible to fraud, spoofing, jamming and cyber-attacks, it does not provide any proof of origin or authentication and therefore it is unreliable by itself to prove claims of locations. Moreover, GPS cannot provide indoor localization, it underperforms in high density urban environments, i.e. increased signal multipath, and its energy consumption is prohibitive for low-power devices.
Such vulnerabilities have been prominently identified in smart watches6 as well as in military cyber-attacks affecting thousands of civilian ships [2]. Despite these limitations, there is active research on building secure and privacy-preserving localization solutions based on GPS by introducing additional protocol and security mechanisms, for instance, GPS-based active crowd localization based on digital signatures and bulletin boards applied for tracking lost items [4,131].

Other means to verify witness presence include the following: Contextual QR codes [102], challenge questions, puzzles and CAPTCHA-like tests [109], whose solutions require information mined at the point of interests.

In terms of the crypto-economic incentive model, a utility token [13] can be used to reward (i) citizens and communities for introducing localization infrastructure for location proofs, (ii) the establishment of social proofs in points of interests for proving
social claims, or (iii) the use computational resources for validation of the witness presence claims in the consensus network.

In all these cases, permissionless
participation requires staking that is the commit of a deposit token value, while faults resulting in violations of the protocol rules (slashing conditions) result in penalties. These are usually magnitudes higher than the anticipated short term rewards. Therefore, the entry cost, existence cost and exit penalty can make proofs of witness presence resistant to Sybil attacks.

A child chain is constructed for each point of interest running synchronous consensus for clock synchronization. In contrast, a parent chain holds the staked tokens and the smart contracts that represent the different child chains. The parent chain may rely on an asynchronous consensus network in Ethereum.

A self-sovereign identity management system [81] can be used to authenticate citizens’ actions in the proposed permissionless distributed ledger, i.e. verifying the actual citizen who issued
a witness presence claim to prevent double participation that can influence the result of collective decisions.

Zero-knowledge proofs are applied and the minimum data required for verification are shared [17].

# Privacy-Preserving Traffic Management: A Blockchain and Zero-Knowledge Proof Inspired Approach

In this paper, we focus on a particular kind of ZKP, called zero-knowledge range proof (ZKRP), which is closely related
to ZKSM protocols.

Therefore, ZKRP can be applied to many kinds of decentralized applications that have numeric intervals along with other requirements, such as e-voting systems [19], [20] and e-auction systems [21], [22].

In the design of Gateway Validation, ZKRP is a method by which one traversing vehicle proves to the gateway (verifier) that it comes from a specific blockchain network N (δ) covering location δ, without conveying any information apart from the fact that it comes from the location δ. The proposed ZKRP scheme protects the privacy of vehicular information in the process of switching blockchain networks.

C. ZERO-KNOWLEDGE PROOF FOR BLOCKCHAIN
Zero-knowledge proof enables one party to prove the knowledge to another party without conveying any information about the knowledge. Zcash implements the zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (ZK-SNARK) to protect the transaction privacy in cryptocurrency network [46]. Koens et al. [18] proposed an efficient zero-knowledge range proof in Ethereum without the interactive communications between participants. In addition, Bullet-proofs are proposed for efficient range proofs on committed values, which are short non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs without a trusted setup process [47].

# Blockchain for secure location verification

In location-sensitive applications, dishonest users may submit fake location claims to illegally access a service or obtain benefit. To address this issue, a number of location proof mechanisms have been proposed in literature. However, they confront various security and privacy challenges, including Prover–Prover collusions (Terrorist Frauds), Prover–Witness collusions, and location privacy threats.

In these services, mobile users’ real-time location data is utilized by a location-based service provider (LBSP) to provide users with requested information or access to a resource or service. These applications are fast growing and very popular due to the range of useful services they offer [8,23,29,39].
However, these services and applications are vulnerable to location spoofing attacks since dishonest users are incentivized to lie about their location and submit fake position data [21,28,35,44].

Comparison of LP schemes.

In this paper, we do not adopt a DB protocol to check the proximity of a prover to a witness. Instead, the time-limited mechanism (discussed in the security challenges) enables the witness to check whether the prover is really located in its vicinity or not. This makes the LP generation process much faster than the current solutions (see Section 7 for a comparison).

# Blockchain Based Zero-Knowledge Proof of Location in IoT

The location data depict someone’s digital trace which gives more contextual information such as individuals’ habits, interests, activities and relationships. This information exposes the user to an unwanted advertisement and location-based spams/scams, causing social reputation or economic damage and making them victims of blackmail or even physical violence [16]. Moreover, location data are insecurely transmitted and stored, and uncontrollable by its owner in traditional mode.

In this paper, we bring zero-knowledge proof to LBSs for the first time, proposing zk-PoL protocol which consists of generation scheme and verification scheme. This protocol allows a user to achieve hierarchical, user-controllable privacy protection by choosing different input parameters.

# Achieving Blockchain-based Privacy-Preserving Location Proofs under Federated Learning

Specifically, the proposed scheme utilizes a Threshold Identity-Based Encryption (TIBE) system for the generation of secret shares, such that each anonymous location proof can only be verified with at least a threshold number of participants. In addition, the proposed scheme exploits a cuckoo filter for the secure and efficient maintenance and dissemination of location proofs.

First, we propose our privacy-preserving location proof acquisition scheme, which utilizes a threshold encryption system to hide the location proof owners and the location proofs can only be successfully verified with at least a threshold number of users.
Second, we achieve the secure storage and dissemination of location proofs, which combines a cuckoo filter to efficiently structure the location proofs, and a permissioned blockchain with the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus to disseminate location proofs.

# Location-aware Verification for Autonomous Truck Platooning Based on Blockchain and Zero-knowledge Proof

Our proposed system integrates zero-knowledge proof with permissioned
blockchain technology. By performing the ZKP-based identity verification within the spatially-local area defined by a given platoon, our system can provide lower latency verification with less communication overhead compared to a location-agnostic system. To analyze the system performance, we prototype our design on Hyperledger platform.

# Robust Decentralized Proof of Location for Blockchain Energy Applications Using Game Theory and Random Selection

Key pair encryption and private key signing have been defined mainly for human identification in blockchain applications, where users are personally and responsibly concerned about the confidentiality of their private key. These methods are not suitable for computing nodes whose private key is implemented in the software they run. Ensuring that transactions are issued by a legitimate sender with the proper credentials is a bigger concern in applications with financial stakes.

Location based services is a growing technology that focuses on providing GIS and spatial data through mobile and field devices. Location-based apps and services have gained popularity in recent years due to the variety of useful services they provide. These include activity tracking apps, location-based services, cognitive radio networks (CRNs), and location-based access control systems, which are used in both established and emerging domains. Navigation software, social networking services, location-based advertising, and tracking systems are all examples of location-based services [18,19]. These location-based applications/services may also be used in other access control systems that require a proximity sensor, such as in a critical healthcare system or for entertainment purposes, where these systems may only provide content to users who are in a particular area of interest while charging users who are in a different location [20].

It has been shown how, with two counter-parties, as in the case of blockchain-based energy applications, a game-theoretic scenario arises in which equilibrium is only possible if all participating verifiers state the true origin of the token request, and how, with two counter-parties, it is possible to implement a decentralized and unpredictable random selection of verifiers to reduce the likelihood of collusion between them. As part of this work, a detailed description of the architecture and functioning of this platform and its implementation was undertaken. The goal of this work was to shed light on the relevance of the proposed
platform and evaluate it using relevant metrics.

# Privacy-preserving Proof-of-Location With Security Against Geo-tampering

A Proof-of-Location (POL) system is used to issue a proof-of-location token (pol) to a user who has been present at a location loc, such that it can be later presented to a verifier to assure the presence of the user at loc. Basic POL security requirements are unforgeability of pol, and its non-transferability (a pol issued to user u1 cannot be used by u2 ). An additional important property of POL systems is user privacy against the issuers and verifiers. We make two contributions. First, we formalize the POL security and privacy properties, and construct the first system providing provable security and privacy against the issuer and the verifier, both.

Second, we introduce a geo-tampering attack that completely breaks POL system security, by simply changing the location of a pol issuing node. The attack applies to portable infrastructure nodes that are not continually monitored. We propose an algorithm that is used by a pol issuer to provide a location integrity “proof”, that will be embedded in a pol to protect against this attack. The proof relies on a novel application of Euclidean Distance Matrices. We implemented our POL on an off-the-shelf Android smartphone to show the practicality of the proposed algorithms.

assuming the infrastructure nodes have correct location.

The properties for POL are defined based on the POL Game. Conditions to win the game however vary depending on the property. We define three POL properties: unforgeability, non-transferability and anonymity. The following definition were motivated in Section 1, and assume integrity of the access points’ locations (access points are always assumed to correctly perform the computation).

We provided a formal model and security definition for proof-of-location systems that provide privacy for the user against pol issuer and verifier, and proposed a proof-of-location system with provable properties in our model. We introduced a novel attack that targets the physical integrity
of the proof issuing infrastructure, and results in forged pol.

We showed how EDM can be effectively used to provide provable protection against this attack. Using EDM for infrastructure integrity is a novel approach and can have applications to other location systems. We also implemented our proof-of-location scheme on android smart-phones to
observe computational time and storage requirement. Optimal placement of access points given the physical restrictions of indoor environments to naturally protect against geo-tampering is an interesting research direction.

# Location-Proof System based on Secure Multi-Party Computations

In this paper, a solution is presented in which a malicious adversary, acting as a prover, cannot cheat on his position and remain undetected. It relies on multi-party computations and group-signature schemes to protect the private information of both the prover and the witnesses against any semi-honest participant.

However, for some services such as electronic voting, location-based access control, and law enforcement investigation, this is not the case. These services must be based on a location-proof system that allows a participant, called prover, to obtain proofs from nearby participants, called witnesses, asserting that he is at a given location at a given time. Such a proof can be presented later on to convince a service provider, called verifier.

Any location-proof systems based on the interaction between a prover and his neighbors have some privacy issues. The prover may not want to broadcast his identity and his location every time he needs location-proofs. Similarly, witnesses may want to hide their identity and their location. Hence, private information must be kept secret from all the participants but not from an independent trusted third-party, called judge. Indeed, the judge must be allowed to retrieve the identities of the participants, in order to detect collusions with the prover.

An ideal location-proof system must then have the following properties:
Correctness, Non-transferability, Traceability, Location and Identity privacy, Unlinkability, Storage sovereignty

Our scheme relies on multi-party computations and group signature schemes to protect the identity and the location of all participants. It assumes also that the participants have mobiles/vehicles with directional antenna to locate their neighbors. Such a solution can complement the classical distance-bounding protocols [1].

Our scheme relies on a novel secure multi-party computation protocol, allowing a third-party to find which participant has the maximum value and approximating the region in which he is. The proofs are then signed with a group signature scheme, protecting the identity of the participants and allowing to detect any adversary trying to impersonate multiple witnesses.
