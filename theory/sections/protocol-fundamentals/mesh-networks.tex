Dynamic and non-hierarchic mesh networks are a type of wireless network architecture that allows for the creation of ad-hoc networks in which nodes can communicate with each other without the need for a central coordinating device. This type of network is characterized by its ability to self-organize and dynamically adapt to both changes in the environment and in the overall network topology. As presented in Section~\ref{sec:background-wireless-mesh-networks}, one of the key features that materializes the concept of dynamic and non-hierarchic mesh networks is the existence and implementation of lower-layer routing protocols, such as \emph{batman-adv}, to facilitate the peer-to-peer communication between the nodes.
