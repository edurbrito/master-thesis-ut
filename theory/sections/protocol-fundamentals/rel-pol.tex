Assuming zone-relative spatio-temporal soundness, what is left is to make use of it for producing a verifiable \pol{} certificate. This section will provide a description of the \pol{} certificate generation process, its requirements, and a possible verification procedure that is derived from the \pol{} protocol's design. Building upon the steps achieved in the previous sections, it is assumed that a zone has been established, and that the zone members are able to achieve time-conscious consensus. Concretely, we assume that both the prover and the witnesses restrict their communication to the zone's physical boundaries, dictated by the coverage of the short-ranged communication means they have agreed to use. We also assume that the zone members are able to achieve zone-relative time synchronization, and thus pace the events of the protocol's execution at the same rate. The next step is to establish the proof generation process, which is based on the zone's relative time and space. The higher goal is to assert that the prover is at a specific location, at a specific time, relative to the witnesses, which means, in practical terms, that the prover is able to communicate via the same short-ranged communication means with all the witnesses and is able to demonstrate that it is, as well, synchronized with their internal clocks. Therefore, to assert such propositions, the following steps are required:
