\noindent\textbf{Abstract:}

\noindent

Location-based services have become ubiquitous in today's world, and their integration with a wide range of applications and technologies has shaped humankind's interaction with the physical reality. However, the current state of these systems is very far from ensuring integrity of the location data, especially in trustless environments with no individual honesty guarantees. A paradigm shift is needed, in order to provide security against geo-tampering or location spoofing. To address such requirements, digital and verifiable \pol{} systems may help on conceptualizing the idea of location-based authentication or authorization, in adversarial environments. Envisioned is a vast range of applications, in the fields of smart cities, augmented democracy, digital integrity, liability, and internet transparency. This thesis presents a novel approach to the problem, charting the \pol{} systems' paradigm and building upon existing work, to further uncover the path towards fully trustless and decentralized \pol{}. Making use of mesh network technologies and permissionless consensus mechanisms, we specify a new protocol, and implement and evaluate a \poc{}, showcasing the generation of complete, verifiable, and spatio-temporally sound location proofs.
