The \pol{} problem was the main target of this thesis. Through theoretical and practical contributions, the problem was comprehensively dissected. The identification of the underlying concepts, hypotheses, and real-world applications was followed by a review of the state of the art, encompassing a wide range of trust levels and infrastructural scenarios. Inspired by previous work, this thesis delivered a novel approach to the problem. The proposed solution involved the specification of a decentralized \pol{} protocol and the implementation of a \poc{}. The final work mixes routing protocols for mobile ad hoc mesh networks and permissionless consensus mechanisms, in order to finally achieve collective agreement on one's presence in a specific location, at a certain point in time. The protocol was showcased in a distributed setting, featuring a modular network architecture that separates concerns between the different stages. The chosen technologies showed optimistic results that make the work suitable and adaptable to resource-constrained environments. The proposed protocol is a promising step towards achieving Absolute \pol{} in a decentralized and trustless manner.

The groundwork for the implementation of a novel \pol{} protocol has been established, but further investigation is still needed, for instance, to identify the most effective identity management systems and crypto-economic incentives to motivate nodes to collaborate and establish and maintain coverage zones, with the research on the processes of zone discovery and zone affinity management revealing to be essential for the overall success of the protocol. Another aspect that deserves further investigation is the shift from deterministic-finality Byzantine fault-tolerant algorithms to probabilistic finality consensus mechanisms. Formal verifications, measurements, and comparisons of the two approaches are necessary to determine the best candidates for decentralized \pol{}. Furthermore, this thesis has demonstrated the simplest case of applying a consensus mechanism to achieve time synchronization. Extending the approach to reach more accurate location attestations, making full use of the system's Turing Completeness for more complex logic, and ensuring the extensibility of the approach are all areas for future work. A thorough analysis of the robustness, security, privacy, and correctness of the baseline solution is also to be presented. The integration of privacy preserving mechanisms, such as zero-knowledge proofs, is also a point of interest. Ultimately, the deployment of the solution in physical devices and the evaluation of the performance in real-world scenarios is the missing step towards the full realization of the work.
