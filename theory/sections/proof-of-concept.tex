This chapter details the steps taken to develop and evaluate the \poc{} implementation. Section~\ref{sec:proof-of-concept-infrastructure} provides an overview of the infrastructure, while Section~\ref{sec:proof-of-concept-pol-implementation} describes the implementation of the \pol{} protocol, after the establishment of the baseline network architecture. Finally, Section~\ref{sec:proof-of-concept-results} presents some measurements of the \poc{} evaluation. All the software developed, along with complementing documentation, is available at the repository referenced in Appendix~\ref{appendix:repository}.
