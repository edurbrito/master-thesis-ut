This section presents a nuanced description of the current state of the \pol{} problem, spanning the spectrum of its trust levels, from fully trusted to permissionless environments. Furthermore, it encompasses an assessment of the typical infrastructural scenarios, detailing the progressive shift from centralized to decentralized systems. The organization of the section is as follows. Section~\ref{sec:related-work-trusted-centralized} outlines the starting point in a trusted and centralized setting. Section~\ref{sec:related-work-distributed-decentralized} details the progressive shift towards distributed and decentralized protocols. Section~\ref{sec:related-work-fully-trustless} presents the most recent developments in the \pol{} problem, which ultimately target permissionless and fully trustless setups. Finally, alternative strategies to the prevailing \pol{} protocols, which this thesis mainly addresses, are presented in Section~\ref{sec:related-work-alternative-strategies}.


% From Group Time-based One-time Passwords and its Application to Efficient Privacy-Preserving Proof of Location:

% King [31] proposes FOAM that relies on decentralized and
% trusted zone anchor beacons with synchronized clocks.

% Wu et al. [50] proposed a blockchain-based zero-knowledge proof of location scheme. The
% user obtains a location certificate from a number of location beacons, as in FOAM, and generates a zero-knowledge proof of its with the help of the beacons

% The existing decentralized proof of location schemes use digital signatures, which may render them impractical for running frequently on low-power devices. Furthermore, they lack formal security analysis. Our PoL based on GTOTP is efficient because it does not use digital signatures, and it is provably secure. ---- No time synchrnization, or it may need to rely on an external trusted time source: Group Time-based One-time Passwords
