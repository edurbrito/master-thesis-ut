This chapter presents a description of the current state of the \pol{} problem, spanning the spectrum of its trust levels, from fully trusted to permissionless environments. Furthermore, it encompasses an assessment of the typical infrastructural scenarios, detailing the progressive shift from centralized to decentralized systems. The organization of the chapter is as follows. Section~\ref{sec:related-work-trusted-centralized} outlines the starting point in a trusted and centralized setting. Section~\ref{sec:related-work-distributed-decentralized} details the progressive shift towards distributed and decentralized protocols. Section~\ref{sec:related-work-fully-trustless} presents the most recent developments in the \pol{} problem, which ultimately target permissionless and fully trustless setups. 

% Finally, alternative strategies to the prevailing \pol{} protocols, which this thesis mainly addresses, are presented in Section~\ref{sec:related-work-alternative-strategies}.
