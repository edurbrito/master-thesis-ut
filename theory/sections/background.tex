This section introduces not only the underlying concepts that sustain the work, but also the technology involved in implementing the proposed practical solution. First, in Section \ref{sec:proof-of-location}, we state the proof-of-location problem, its participants, and common threat models. Section \ref{sec:wireless-mesh-networks} reviews the concept of Wireless Mesh Networks and related routing protocols for establishing nearby witnessing. Lastly, Section \ref{sec:permissionless-consensus} introduces the permissionless consensus problem and its role in obtaining a location proof in a trustless environment.

\TODO{Notice the still non-consistent way of referring to stuff like “proof-of-location“ and “proof-of-concept“. Should I strictly define and use a consistent terminology, like always “proof-of-location“, or “Proof-of-Location“, or define “PoL“ and use the abbreviation?}
