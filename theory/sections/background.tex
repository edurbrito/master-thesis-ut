This chapter introduces not only the underlying concepts that sustain the work, but also the technology involved in implementing the proposed practical solution. First, in Section~\ref{sec:background-proof-of-location}, we state and define the \pol{} problem, its participants, the most common threat models, and a non-exhaustive list of some application scenarios. Section~\ref{sec:background-wireless-mesh-networks} reviews the concept of Wireless Mesh Networks and related routing protocols for establishing nearby witnessing. Lastly, Section~\ref{sec:background-permissionless-consensus} introduces the permissionless consensus problem and its role in achieving agreement for obtaining a location proof in a trustless environment.
