This section introduces not only the underlying concepts that sustain the work, but also the technology involved in implementing the proposed practical solution. First, in Section~\ref{sec:proof-of-location}, we state the \pol{} problem, its participants, and common threat models. Section~\ref{sec:wireless-mesh-networks} reviews the concept of Wireless Mesh Networks and related routing protocols for establishing nearby witnessing. Lastly, Section~\ref{sec:permissionless-consensus} introduces the permissionless consensus problem and its role in obtaining a location proof in a trustless environment.
